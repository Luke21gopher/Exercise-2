<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p><b>If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?</b></p>

<h2>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
<p>I admire my grandpa for his unshakable faith, kind heart and brilliant creativity. He had a gentle nature and served as a bright light to anyone that came ntact with him. Growing up I always aspired to be like him. Now that he’s left this Earth I’ve made it my mission to carry on his legacy and spirit. <br> Another person I admire is Bailey Kearns, my girlfriend. She always has my back and is always there for me.</p>
